it's wild to me that 2024 is here. i barely got used to calendars saying it was 2023 and now here we are. back in 2020 i was 13 and had no idea who i was or where i was going, but i didn't know that. looking back on the world these past four years, so much shit has happened, and the world has changed in so many ways and we are still trying to process living in a period that future historians will spend their whole lives trying to understand.


2023 was kinda *just* a year for me. that's all it really was. me and some friends were talking last night and i realised that i didn't really do anything notable? like if i look back i know that's bullshit, like i made [a game and it's actually kinda fun](https://sandiwch.itch.io/penguin-dash), but when you can't think of a reason to remember 2023 above 2021 or 2022 it makes me think i could've done better.

here's hoping 2024 blows my fuckin mind
